# Drone Communications Analysis & Network Reconnaissance

This project demonstrates how to analyze and interpret drone communications using open-source tools in a controlled environment. Using Python, MAVProxy, and Wireshark, I established a connection between my computer and a drone via Mission Planner and performed packet-level reconnaissance on MAVLink traffic.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Network Protocol Analysis ‚Äì Observing UDP traffic between devices (drone and GCS).
- Packet Capture with Wireshark ‚Äì Analyzing MAVLink messages and device behavior.
- IP Discovery & Mapping ‚Äì Identifying the IPs of the host (192.168.4.27) and drone (192.168.4.20).
- Command-Line Tool Proficiency ‚Äì Installing and using mavproxy.py via pip.
- Python Network Interaction ‚Äì Setting up and launching MAVProxy.
- Ethical Reconnaissance ‚Äì Conducted in a safe, isolated network lab.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python ‚Äì For installing and running MAVProxy.
- Command Prompt ‚Äì Command-line interface to interact with tools.
- MAVProxy ‚Äì CLI ground control station for MAVLink.
- Mission Planner ‚Äì GUI ground station for monitoring the drone.
- Wireshark ‚Äì Network sniffer for capturing and analyzing packets.
- Smartphone ‚Äì Used as a secondary network device to generate activity and perform pings.

## üìã Project Workflow

1. Environment Setup  
Installed Python and MAVProxy using:  
pip install mavproxy  
Configured Mission Planner for UDP communication.

2. Connecting to the Drone  
Ran MAVProxy with:  
mavproxy.py --master=com3 --baudrate=57600 --out=udp:192.168.4.25:14550 --console

3. Capturing Network Traffic  
Started Wireshark on the host machine.  
Interacted with the drone via Mission Planner and monitored MAVLink traffic.

4. Identifying IP Addresses  
Drone: 192.168.4.20  
Host PC: 192.168.4.25  
Used smartphone to ping drone IP to confirm visibility on the local network.

## üîç Observations & Takeaways

- Successfully captured MAVLink UDP packets.
- Identified how the drone and GCS communicate over the local network.
- Highlighted activity during critical drone actions (arming).
- Reinforced skills in packet analysis and ethical reconnaissance.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Analyze MAVLink packet contents for telemetry and control commands.
- Write Python scripts to parse MAVLink data from .pcap files.
- Simulate and detect spoofed MAVLink packets in a lab setting.
- Explore secure MAVLink alternatives or encryption options.
